# AFION-LAB
The **Autonomous Fluidic Identification and Optimization Nanochemistry (AFION)** project presents a self-driving laboratory system designed to revolutionize the synthesis of metal nanoparticles (NPs) by integrating microfluidic reactors, in-flow spectroscopic NP characterization, and machine learning techniques. 

In this program, general AFION platform control package, NP size measurement code and related size distribution analysis, and data analysis sections are avaialble to generate results that are reported in the paper and central to the main claims.
