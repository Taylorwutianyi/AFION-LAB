### Variation in objectives of the Best Recipes for NP Synthesis

Understanding the variation in the best recipe for NP synthesis is crucial for optimizing the process. The project showcases a code snippet that explores this aspect by analyzing the impact of different parameters on the outcome. This analysis aids in identifying the conditions that yield consistent and desired nanoparticle properties, facilitating the development of robust synthesis protocols.

### Installation

To plot the variation in best recipe, run 'variation.ipynb' in jupyter notebook.
