Column A - "#": number of experiment; 
	the first 100 experiments are gold nanorods (AuNRs),  
	the next 80 experiments are alloy nanoparticles(NPs), 
	the following 35 experiments are core-shell NPs, 
	and the last 50 experiments are gold nanotetrapods. 

Column B to H: reaction parameters, including:
	concentration of gold (Au) precursor, 
	concentration of silver (Ag) precursor, 
	concentration of surfactant CTAB,
	concentration of and photoreducing agent I2959,
	UV irradiation intensity, 
	reaction time, 
	and oscillation speed. 

Column I to P: results, including:
	number of peaks, 
	1st wavelength peak position (wl1), 
	full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for the 1st peak (FWHM1), 
	peak intensity (ISPR1) for the 1st peak. 
	2nd wavelength peak position (wl2), 
	FWHM2 dor the 2nd peak, 
	peak intensity (ISPR2) for the 2nd peak 
	the peak intensity at 400 nm. 

Column Q: is the "note", in which, 
	"R" represents AuNRs (2 peaks), 
	"0" represents no reaction, 
	"XR" represents no AuNRs being formed as only one single peak being detected, 
	"S" represents alloy NPs, 
	"CS" represents core-shell NPs, 
	"TBD" represents to be determined (something I don't know), 
	"NT" represents gold nanotetrapods.
