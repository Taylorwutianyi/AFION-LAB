### 3D Correlation Graph

The project employs a 3D Correlation graph visualization technique to unveil intricate relationships between different reaction parameters and the outcome. By utilizing matplotlib, scikit-learn, and interactive widgets, this approach offers an engaging and interactive platform to explore how important parameters impact the outcome categories of nanoparticles. 

### Installation

To generate the 3D graphs, run '3D.ipynb' in jupyter notebook.
