## General AFION Platform Control Software Code

Integration of microfluidic reactors and in-flow spectroscopic NP characterization.
- Application of machine learning algorithm (Gryffin) for optimization of metal NP synthesis.
- Precise control of optical properties based on NP spectroscopic characteristics.
- General platform control package, nanoparticle size measurement, and data analysis.

### Installation

The optimization algorithm (Gryffin) is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/gryffin). Installation guide of Gryffin is included in its Github repository.

The control code for the platform is customized and runs on Window Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS) on Windows 10. The control codes of individual instruments in the platform, including pumps, spectrometer and UV light, are included in 'PythonLab' package with the installation guidance inside.

After installing 'Pythonlab' package, to start the experiemnts, run 'run_platform.py'.
